# Game title: "Speed up"

we chose this title for our story game because the events revolve around two freinds trapped
in a room in a nuclear power plant and the players must find a solution and get out quickly because the place will blow after one minute only.

Steps
============

Players must pass through several situations and enter different paths in order to find a solution and regain their freedom. Also, you will see that there is not only one end, there are 3 endings that depend on your choices and your way to problem-solving.
The way to play this game requires you to enter the answers to solve the questions,
only one of these two friends has to use the computer and make all decisions during the game, and the other encourages him and monitors all situations. 

Summarization about the game
============
-------------------     ----------------------------
“You’re trapped in a dungeon with your friend. You see a barrel. What do you do? ” 
If he chooses to write in the game: "Move the barrel". The barrel will roll to the side and you find a secret tunnel.
When they enter the tunnel they will receive a message from the game saying: “You start to escape but your friend is too weak to go with you. He hands you a note. What do you do?” while the player is waiting to see the note he will receive a message saying: “It is too dark to read the note. What you do?”
 If the player turns on the light to read the note he will find nothing and loses the game (First end).
Or if he chooses to continue escaping he will get a message:
“You crawl through the tunnel and the tunnel leads you to a beach. What do you do?” the player will think now if he has to hide and in this case he will lose
(Second end), but if the player chooses to look around instead of hiding he will got a message: “In the water you see a boat. What do you do?” he gets on the boat, and when he does that he will receive a message saying: “Congratulations, you’re heading to a new world!”
 Guess what? You think they won, oh no! They'll still hear the alarm.

The game asks them if they want to play again
As we saw before the first message of the game is:
“You’re trapped in a dungeon with your friend. You see a barrel. What do you do?”
 he chooses now to leave the barrel, and here the game says:  Your friend hands you a note. What do you do?
“The note says, “Don’t leave me here.” Do you leave your friend or stay?”
If he chooses to stay with his friend:
“Congratulations, you’re a good friend which will never leave his friends alone!”
(Third ending)
